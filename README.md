# Planner

The application is in ongoing development and requires at least Java 8. You can find the jar file for the application in the /build/libs directory. Please use the Planner-all.jar file, which was generated by the shadow plugin for Gradle.

You will need a specific .properties file to connect to the MySQL database hosted by AWS RDS. You can contact me for that .properties file. I might also provide the SQL scripts in the near future so that you can create the database and its tables on your local host and thus run my application on your machine without the need for the .properties file (assuming you have the latest version of MySQL installed).
