# Planner

The application is in ongoing development and requires at least Java 8. You can find the jar file for the application in the /build/libs directory. Please use the Planner-all.jar file, which was generated by the shadow plugin for Gradle.

You will need a specific .properties file to connect to the MySQL database hosted by AWS RDS. You can contact me for that .properties file. I might also provide the SQL scripts in the near future so that you can create the database and its tables on your local host and thus run my application on your machine without the need for the .properties file (assuming you have the latest version of MySQL installed).

NOTES:
- The application is gradually being converted to using the JPA and Hibernate frameworks for the databases. Currently, it is using JDBC, which will be maintained, and in some cases, still used over JPA/Hibernate whenever JDBC is simpler or more convenient.
- With the help of Spring Boot, APIs are currently being implemented for this application. The APIs are not production ready yet, but will most likely be hosted on Heroku once they are.
- The application code "somewhat" follows the MVC design pattern, but I am re-factoring the code to more strictly adhere to that design pattern.
