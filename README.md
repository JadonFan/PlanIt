# Planner

The application is in ongoing development and requires at least Java 8. You can find the jar file for the application in the /build/libs directory. Please use the Planner-all.jar file, which was generated by the shadow plugin for Gradle.

The code will use Hibernate instead of JDBC for the databases in the future.
